# 02-Challenge - Code Refactoring

## Description

- The code was arranged in rudimentary html and css elements and needed to be consolidated.
- I set out to rectify the code and make it much simpler and more accessible.
- I managed to cut the css file in half and introduce semantic html throughout the index file.
- I learned a great deal about structuring code and the necessity of using clear and well defined elements, classes, and IDs.

## Installation

The project is a simple web page and can be viewed using any web browser.

## Usage

The web page retains all original functionality, and the simplicity of the code can be viewed using the inspect tool.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
